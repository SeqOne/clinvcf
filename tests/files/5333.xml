        <Attribute Type="Description">Soranzo et al. (2005) identified a 516G-T transversion in the TAS2R16 gene, resulting in a lys172-to-asn (K172N) substitution (rs846664), as a polymorphism in humans. The substitution lies in the second extracellular loop domain of the receptor, which may affect ligand interactions. In K172N-transfected HEK293 cells, they showed that the asn172 residue resulted in approximately 2-fold greater activation of the receptor in response to bitter compounds, particularly beta-glucopyranosides (BGLPT; 617956) (salicin, arbutin, amygdalin) compared to the lys172 residue. Analysis of 997 individuals from 60 human populations indicated that the K172N SNP was subject to positive selection and that it arose between 77,700 and 791,000 years ago. Soranzo et al. (2005) speculated that the asn172 residue offered increased protection against cyanogenic plant foods and natural toxins in general, as man became active as a hunter-gatherer. The observation of the moderate frequency of the ancestral lys172 allele in Africa was hypothesized to play a role in protection against malaria.</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">Campbell et al. (2014) examined the frequency of the c.516G-T variant in the TAS2R16 gene in a large global population study including 595 individuals from 74 African populations and 94 non-Africans from 11 populations. Among African populations, the frequency of the derivative T allele (N172) was higher in individuals from East Africa compared to West and Central Africa, suggesting strong positive adaptation among East Africans. Haplotype analysis indicated that the N172-bearing H2 haplotype, specific to East Africa, was the oldest haplotype. The T allele was found at 100% frequency in non-Africans, suggesting that the ancestral G allele is rare or absent in populations outside of Africa. Among 296 individuals tested, those with at least one T allele had a higher sensitivity to salicin bitterness compared to individuals homozygous for the ancestral G allele. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the N172 protein had increased trafficking of the receptor to the cell membrane, with 1.5- to 2-fold higher surface expression than the ancestral K172 protein, thus possibly explaining increased bitter taste sensation. However, Campbell et al. (2014) did not find a significant association between decreased bitter taste sensitivity and malaria endemicity among Africans. The authors suggested that the evolutionary forces driving positive selection of the variant may not be diet-related or gustatory in nature. Campbell et al. (2014) suggested that the fixation of the derived T allele outside of Africa may indicated that this variant arose from a population bottleneck during the geographic expansion of modern humans from Africa 40,000 to 80,000 years ago.</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">In 262 families with alcoholism from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) and in 85 trios consisting of an alcohol-dependent individual and 2 parents, Hinrichs et al. (2006) found a significant association (p = 0.00018) between alcohol dependence (103780) and the K172N SNP. The TAS2R16 gene is located on chromosome 7q31 in a region reported to exhibit linkage with alcohol dependence (Reich et al., 1998; Foroud et al., 2000). The risk allele was uncommon in European Americans (minor allele frequency (MAF), 0.6%), whereas it was present in 45% of African Americans in the study (MAF, 26%), suggesting that K172N is a more significant risk factor for alcohol dependence in the African American population.</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">Campbell et al. (2014) examined the frequency of the c.516G-T variant in the TAS2R16 gene in a large global population study including 595 individuals from 74 African populations and 94 non-Africans from 11 populations. Among African populations, the frequency of the derivative T allele (N172) was higher in individuals from East Africa compared to West and Central Africa, suggesting strong positive adaptation among East Africans. Haplotype analysis indicated that the N172-bearing H2 haplotype, specific to East Africa, was the oldest haplotype. The T allele was found at 100% frequency in non-Africans, suggesting that the ancestral G allele is rare or absent in populations outside of Africa. Among 296 individuals tested, those with at least one T allele had a higher sensitivity to salicin bitterness compared to individuals homozygous for the ancestral G allele. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the N172 protein had increased trafficking of the receptor to the cell membrane, with 1.5- to 2-fold higher surface expression than the ancestral K172 protein, thus possibly explaining increased bitter taste sensation. However, Campbell et al. (2014) did not find a significant association between decreased bitter taste sensitivity and malaria endemicity among Africans. The authors suggested that the evolutionary forces driving positive selection of the variant may not be diet-related or gustatory in nature. Campbell et al. (2014) suggested that the fixation of the derived T allele outside of Africa may indicated that this variant arose from a population bottleneck during the geographic expansion of modern humans from Africa 40,000 to 80,000 years ago.</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">In 262 families with alcoholism from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) and in 85 trios consisting of an alcohol-dependent individual and 2 parents, Hinrichs et al. (2006) found a significant association (p = 0.00018) between alcohol dependence (103780) and the K172N SNP. The TAS2R16 gene is located on chromosome 7q31 in a region reported to exhibit linkage with alcohol dependence (Reich et al., 1998; Foroud et al., 2000). The risk allele was uncommon in European Americans (minor allele frequency (MAF), 0.6%), whereas it was present in 45% of African Americans in the study (MAF, 26%), suggesting that K172N is a more significant risk factor for alcohol dependence in the African American population.</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">Soranzo et al. (2005) identified a 516G-T transversion in the TAS2R16 gene, resulting in a lys172-to-asn (K172N) substitution (rs846664), as a polymorphism in humans. The substitution lies in the second extracellular loop domain of the receptor, which may affect ligand interactions. In K172N-transfected HEK293 cells, they showed that the asn172 residue resulted in approximately 2-fold greater activation of the receptor in response to bitter compounds, particularly beta-glucopyranosides (BGLPT; 617956) (salicin, arbutin, amygdalin) compared to the lys172 residue. Analysis of 997 individuals from 60 human populations indicated that the K172N SNP was subject to positive selection and that it arose between 77,700 and 791,000 years ago. Soranzo et al. (2005) speculated that the asn172 residue offered increased protection against cyanogenic plant foods and natural toxins in general, as man became active as a hunter-gatherer. The observation of the moderate frequency of the ancestral lys172 allele in Africa was hypothesized to play a role in protection against malaria.</Attribute>
